# II2202-DataAugmentation-GANs
II2202 research project on data augmentation using GAN, WGAN, and SMOTE for evaluating VGG and other models. Python-based experiments focus on impact assessment through metrics like AUC. Includes code, datasets, and findings on augmentation effectiveness.

The report can be found in this repo as "GAN_Data_Augmentation_Report.pdf" which was marked with the final grade of 80-89% in the course on scientific writing at an advanced level with the Royal Institute of Technology.
